# UEH-ISB-FIN

## Overview
**UEH-ISB-FIN** is my personal portfolio repository, created to showcase my academic and business projects in finance.  
I am **Ha-Phuoc-Trong NGUYEN**, a **Bachelor of Finance and Banking (Applied Finance)** student at the International School of Business (UEH University).  
This repository demonstrates my skills and accomplishments in finance and analysis and is intended to be linked to my rÃ©sumÃ© as proof of my capabilities.

This repository contains selected **academic research papers** and **business-related projects** that I completed during my studies. These works span various areas of finance and business analysis, reflecting my interests in quantitative finance, corporate finance, risk management, and sustainable finance. By sharing these projects, I hope to provide insight into my analytical approach, research experience, and understanding of real-world financial issues.

## Repository Contents
The repository is organised into two main sections, highlighting both scholarly work and practical analysis:

### Academic Projects (Research Papers)
A collection of my academic research papers and projects. These are in-depth studies I have authored or co-authored during my undergraduate programme (often in collaboration with faculty or peers). Topics include, for example, the impact of **green innovation on economic development** and analyses of **financial market behaviour**. Each paper demonstrates my ability to conduct rigorous research, perform data analysis, and communicate findings in a scholarly format, which is also provided at my Google Scholar profile.

### Business Projects (Industry & Financial Analysis)
A compilation of my business-focused projects, including industry analyses, company case studies, and financial modelling projects. In these practical projects, I and my teammates analyse real-world business scenarios, for example:

- **Industry Analysis:** Comprehensive overview of a specific industryâ€™s trends, competitive landscape, and future outlook.  
- **Company Analysis:** Detailed evaluation of an individual company's performance, strategic positioning, and financial health.  
- **Financial Analysis:** Projects such as investment portfolio analysis, risk assessment reports, or corporate financial statement analysis.  

Each project folder contains the relevant documentation (reports, presentations, code notebooks, etc.) along with any supporting data (if required). I have included README files or commentary within those folders to provide context on the objectives, methodologies, and key findings of each project.
